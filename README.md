# Movies Website

A simple React app, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://nbaldzhiev.github.io/movies-react/), to practice React, HTML, and CSS The website's sole purpose is to practice FE development. The React app is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This project is used to practice React and is my first React application. The UI tries to replicate the layout of [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/). The website also uses the TMDB free API:
* [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) is used;

The website allows:
* listing movies or TV shows by movie title or TV show title;
* listing top 10 now playing movies;
* listing top 10 most rated movies of all time on TMDB;

The website is somewhat responsive with a single breakpoint at max-width 768px to allow for better rendering on smartphones.
